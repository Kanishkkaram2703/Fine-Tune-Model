# Project Overview: Image Feature Extraction using the UTKFaces Dataset

## Introduction

This project focuses on the extraction of features from facial images using the UTKFaces dataset. By leveraging image processing techniques and machine learning methods, we aim to analyze demographic attributes such as age, gender, and ethnicity from facial images. This work contributes to the broader field of computer vision and machine learning, providing insights into automated facial recognition and analysis.

## Dataset: UTKFaces

The **UTKFaces** dataset is a large-scale dataset containing over 20,000 face images with annotations for age, gender, and ethnicity. It was collected from various online sources, ensuring diversity in the dataset. Each image is labeled with the following attributes:

- **Age**: Ranging from 0 to 116 years.
- **Gender**: Male or Female.
- **Ethnicity**: Categorizations typically include Asian, Black, and White, among others.

The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new)) and provides a rich resource for training and evaluating machine learning models focused on facial recognition and demographic prediction tasks.

## Objectives

1. **Feature Extraction**: Develop a pipeline to preprocess and extract relevant features from the UTKFaces dataset.
2. **Data Preparation**: Standardize image sizes and formats for consistent input into machine learning models.
3. **Model Training**: Explore the application of machine learning algorithms for tasks such as classification of age, gender, and ethnicity.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

- **Data Loading**: Utilize the UTKFaces dataset, loading images in grayscale format for analysis.
- **Image Resizing**: Resize images to a uniform dimension (e.g., 128x128 pixels) to ensure consistency.
- **Normalization**: Normalize pixel values to enhance model training.

### 2. Feature Extraction Function

The feature extraction function was implemented using the following steps:

```python
def extract_features(images):
    features = []
    for image in tqdm(images):
        img = load_img(image, color_mode='grayscale')
        img = img.resize((128, 128), Image.LANCZOS)
        img = np.array(img)
        features.append(img)
        
    features = np.array(features)
    # ignore this step if using RGB
    features = features.reshape(len(features), 128, 128, 1)
    return features

X = extract_features(df['image'])  # Assuming df['image'] contains paths to the images
```

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation

- **Model Selection**: Depending on the goals, a convolutional neural network (CNN) could be employed to classify age, gender, and ethnicity.
- **Training Process**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Train the model and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Conclusion

This project successfully established a pipeline for extracting features from the UTKFaces dataset, enabling further analysis of demographic attributes from facial images. The findings contribute to the understanding of automated facial recognition systems and highlight the significance of effective data preprocessing in machine learning applications.

### Future Work

Future endeavors could include:
- Implementing more advanced models like transfer learning using pre-trained architectures (e.g., VGGFace, ResNet).
- Exploring data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.
- Expanding the dataset to include additional demographic attributes or to cover other facial analysis tasks.

By continuing to refine and expand this work, we aim to contribute further to the fields of computer vision and facial recognition.
